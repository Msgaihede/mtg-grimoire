/**
 * How the two column views decide which groups share a column.
 *
 * The stack and the text view both lay a deck out as columns read left to right, and both
 * face the same question: a deck has fifteen categories and a column fits two or three of
 * them. The answer is a **greedy pack in the reader's own order** — never a re-ordering, and
 * never a split.
 *
 * Order is the whole constraint. A balanced packer (longest-first, or a bin-packing pass)
 * fits more into fewer columns and puts the Sideboard between Ramp and Removal, which is a
 * deck list nobody can find anything in. `sortOrder` is the reader's, so it survives.
 *
 * The height is measured rather than guessed by the caller: the stack's groups have exact
 * pixel heights (`stackHeight`) and the text view's are a row count times a row pitch, so
 * this takes the measurement as a function and knows nothing about either.
 */

/**
 * `items` split into columns, each no taller than `maxHeight` — in order, and never splitting
 * one item across two columns.
 *
 * An item taller than a whole column gets a column to itself rather than being dropped: a
 * ninety-card main deck is a real pile, and one that vanished for being too big would be the
 * worst bug this file could have.
