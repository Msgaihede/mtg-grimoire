# src/features/decks — the deck builder

**Validation is TypeScript** (spec §3). Rust supplies **facts** (`DeckCardRow`: per-printing
`legalities`, `color_identity`, P/T, `ever_uncommon`, `game_changer`); TS draws **every**
conclusion. The storage side — tables, the seven card commands, the allocator, the audit log —
is [docs/reference/decks-storage.md](../../../docs/reference/decks-storage.md) and
[src-tauri/CLAUDE.md](../../../src-tauri/CLAUDE.md).

## The validation layer

`validation/` is the whole of it:

| File            | Owns                                                                           |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `engine.ts`     | Size, copy limits, restricted semantics, legality                              |
| `singleton.ts`  | Exact-phrase exceptions, **re-derived from oracle text and never a card list** |
| `commanders.ts` | Eligibility, partners, colour identity                                         |
| `companions.ts` | Companion rules                                                                |
| `bracket.ts`    | **Advisory only — `engine.ts` does not import it**                             |

- `oldschool` is the one printing-sensitive legality key, and it comes out right with no special
  case because each row carries its own printing's answer.
- `format_specs` is data seeded in a migration, never an engine branch. `restricted_semantic`
  (`max_one` | `banned_as_commander`) is **never inferred from the key**.

## The category model

- **The name is the user's; the kind is what the rules read.** `deck_cards.category_id` points at
  a row the user names, reorders, switches off and deletes; the fixed word survives only as that
  row's `kind` — `main | side | commander | companion | maybe`, narrowed in TS as `CategoryKind`.
- **`is_active = 0` is the whole of what `maybe` used to mean**, and **nothing anywhere may
  branch on the kind being `maybe`.** An inactive category counts toward nothing — not size, not
  copies, not legality — and the allocator claims no copy for it. That was measured: the old
  shape looked correct and was wrong the first time a user deactivated a pile of their own.
- **`SIZE_KINDS` is `main`, `commander` and `maybe`** — the switch decides whether a pile counts
  at all; the kind decides only whether it is played _beside_ the deck or _in_ it, and only
  `side` and `companion` are beside it (CR 100.4a; EDH's companion is "effectively a 101st
  card"). It is written in **three places that must stay one rule**: `engine.ts`'s constant,
  `deck.rs`'s `DECK_SELECT` subquery behind `DeckRow.card_count`, and the Storybook fake's copy.
- **An add that names no category is filed by the card's type line; an add that names one is
  untouched** — so every _drag_ overrides the rule by construction. The rule is `autoCategoryFor`,
  applied on **`useDeck.addCard`'s single definition**, which takes an optional `typeLine`; the
  fact travels from the call site, so no add pays a round trip to discover what it is adding.
  `null` (an orphan, or a layout with no bucket word) is `Uncategorised`; **absent** is
  `DEFAULT_CATEGORY_NAME`.
- **The "Add to" select's default is `AUTO_CATEGORY`, which is `0`, and that zero fixed a real
  bug** — a deck's seeded categories are in `PREDEFINED_CATEGORIES` order, so a clamp to
  `categories[0]` put every quick add on a fresh deck into **Commander**. Zero now _means_ auto,
  nothing overwrites it, and an explicit pick **stays** picked.

## Writes

- **A write to what is _in_ a deck goes through a `useDeck` mutation**, and `DeckEditor`'s
  `newest([...])` counts **six** of them: update (rename, cover, Built toggle), add-card,
  set-quantity, move, missing-to-wishlist, swap-printing.
- **There is no remove mutation.** The tray's drop and the stepper's zero are both
  `setQuantity(…, 0)`, because zero removes a deck row.
- **The refusal rule lives on the single definition in `useDeck.ts`, never on a call site** — two
  definitions would be two places to keep one rule. The two surfaces outside the editor
  (`useSwapFromPane`, `useSidebarDrops`) borrow a mutation whole and own only their own reporting.
- The deck _row_ is a different hook: the gallery's `useDecks` owns create, update, remove and
  duplicate.
- **`src/features/decks/auditText.ts` is the only thing that reads the audit payload, and the only
  thing that words it** — a sentence is domain logic and the table has to survive the day the
  wording changes. `deck_audit` has no `summary` column and never will.
- **A deck card's unit price is the nonfoil `usd` key of that printing's `prices` blob** — a deck
  names a printing, not a finish. `cards.price_usd` is a fallback chain and is never summed.

## Views and interaction

- **Four views** — `Stacks | Table | Text | Grid` (`DeckEditor`'s `VIEWS`) — crossed with three
  `Group by` modes (`category | manaValue | type`) and four sorts (`alphabetical | manaCost |
price | type`). An **inactive category stays its own group in all three grouping modes**.
- Only `Stacks` and `Grid` fetch a picture, and it is the **whole card** —
  `cardImageUrl(…, DECK_CARD_VARIANT)`, which is `grid`, and which must stay paired with
  `images::prewarm_keys`' `DECK_PREWARM` arm in Rust. **Getting that pairing wrong is invisible**:
  the pre-warm reports success and every tile then fetches cold anyway.
- **A deck card is the whole card, and the app's marks are overlays on it.** The picture _is_ the
  card — no app-drawn frame, name or mana cost — so `deckCardName` on the button is the **only**
  name a screen reader gets. **The marks go right, never left**: a printed name is left-aligned
  and a collapsed stack is read down its reveal strip.
- **`CardStack` is arithmetic, not taste.** The card's height is _derived_ — a Magic card's aspect
  applied to the fixed column width, **295px** — and the collapsed **−261px** margin leaves a
  **34px** reveal, a legibility floor for the overlaid chip rather than a fraction. The list gets
  a fixed `stackHeight(n) = 34(n−1) + 295 + 8`, and the open card's margin turns −261 into +8:
  a **269px** push-down of every later card, out of a box whose height does not change.
- **Exactly one card moves per step, and that is the whole reason the interaction works.**
  Opening card _N+1_ instead of _N_ leaves every other card's top unchanged. The reflow is one
  card sliding out of the stack, not a list resettling — and the pointer that armed it stays
  inside it for every frame.
- **The lift is state, not CSS, because pure CSS could not be given hover intent** (changed
  2026-08-12). The same arithmetic that makes one card move is what broke selection: after the
  first step the next card's strip sits ~34px below the pointer, so one continuous sweep armed
  four or five cards in ~60ms. `CardStack` holds `openIndex`, armed by `pointerenter` after a
  **70ms** dwell (`STACK_OPEN_DWELL_MS`) and closed after **180ms** (`STACK_CLOSE_DELAY_MS`),
  where arming another card cancels the pending close. **No new hit target was needed** — a
  closed card is overlapped by its successor, so its only hittable part already _is_ its 34px
  reveal strip. `LAYER.raisedOnHover`/`raisedOnFocus` are **gone**. The margin is no longer a
  Tailwind literal either — `motion` writes it inline, so the constants are the only place these
  numbers live.
- **The stack comes forward; a card in it never does.** The list takes `LAYER.raised` while
  anything is open, because the cards it pushes down leave its box on purpose. **No card carries
  a z-index at all** — they are `relative` siblings, so painting order is document order, and
  each card drawn over the one before it _is_ the stacked look. Raising the open card inverts
  that for the whole tail of the stack, on the first frame, while the cards after it are still
  269px from where they are going: it reads as the card jumping in front and the stack catching
  up around it. They uncover it instead. **jsdom paints nothing, so only the live pass can prove
  this** — see [docs/reference/decks-storage.md](../../../docs/reference/decks-storage.md).
- **`data-stack-open` exists so a test or a `cdp.mjs --probe` can _count_ open cards** — the CSS
  lift was observable from neither.
- **`onFocus`/`onBlur` sit on the `<li>`, not the button**, which is `focus-within`'s old reach
  and is load-bearing: `DeckCardControls` is a _sibling_ of the button, so a caret stepping into
  the stepper would otherwise collapse the card out from under itself. The keyboard opens with
  **no dwell** — a caret is a deliberate act.
- **React never listens for `pointerenter`.** It synthesises enter/leave from
  `pointerover`/`pointerout`, so `fireEvent.pointerEnter` fires an event the component cannot
  hear and the test passes having called nothing — drive these with `fireEvent.pointerOver`/
  `pointerOut`. And **`userEvent` cannot be driven under Vitest fake timers at all**: RTL's
  `asyncWrapper` waits on a real `setTimeout` it only knows how to advance through _Jest_, so
  such a test hangs to its timeout rather than failing.
- **The stack's lift is `motion`-driven, so it has no CSS transition to probe** and its
  reduced-motion opt-out is `useReducedMotion()` — see [the Motion rules](../../CLAUDE.md) in
  `src/CLAUDE.md`. That hook reads its value once at mount, so emulating
  `prefers-reduced-motion` _after_ mount proves nothing about it.
- **Four card surfaces outside the editor are drag sources, all through the one `cardDraggable`**,
  carrying `{ kind: "card"; cardId; name; typeLine }`. The `typeLine` is **normalised rather than
  validated** — `readDragData` refuses a bad `cardId` or `name`, but turns an unusable type line
  into `null`, because the pile is all it decides and `Uncategorised` is already the answer for
  not knowing. The remove tray narrows to `"deck-card"`, so a card from another wall never draws
  it.
- **A printings row in the card pane is clickable to view that printing** — `store.viewPrinting`
  sets `selectedCardId` _without_ clearing `paneDeckContext`, so the swap offers survive browsing.
  `setSelectedCardId` there instead silently kills the affordance at its one moment of use.
- The editor's five full-window surfaces (Import, Categories & tags, History, Theory diff, Deck
  settings) are held in **one** piece of state, because `useDismissOnEscape` orders exactly two
  rungs and two `"inner"` peers open at once are not ordered at all.

## Known open bugs

Three, found by driving the shipped window and **none of them fixed** — the title row collapsing
the deck name at 1060–1350px, a custom deck cover never appearing in the gallery, and Table view
starving the card name. Detail and measurements:
[docs/reference/decks-live-findings.md](../../../docs/reference/decks-live-findings.md).
